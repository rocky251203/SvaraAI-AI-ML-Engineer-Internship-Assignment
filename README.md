# SvaraAI-AI-ML-Engineer-Internship-Assignment
Problem Statement  At SvaraAI, we build ML-powered features for outbound sales. One core task is to classify replies from prospects into categories (e.g., interested, not interested, neutral) so that sales reps know where to focus their efforts.  Your assignment is to design, implement, and deploy a simple reply classification pipeline.
